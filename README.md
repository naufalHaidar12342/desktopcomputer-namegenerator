Generic-looking name generator for your computer

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Start to use this tool

Spin the dice! Then, write down the generated computer name on a piece of paper (sticky notes also good), or write it down on your notepad from mobile phone, other computer, etc.

If you do not want to manually write it down, a copy to clipboard button also available to use. It would require your permission first for write access on your clipboard

## Why I made this tool?

Every few months, I like to reinstall Windows to make my computer feels fresh. And every time I reached the "Create your local account" step, I'm out of idea just like when I try to name my character in game
